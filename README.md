# FMMs-in-GNNs

This repository hosts the Code for the paper "The Split Matters: Flat Minima Methods for Improving the Performance of GNNs" accepted at CD-MAKE 2023.
Link to arxiv version: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09121

I will add a walkthrough and examples how to use the code to run experiments soon.
